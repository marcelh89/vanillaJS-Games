This is a demo of using html canvas and Javascript to build a 2d tower defense Game.
It is based on a video tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxYg8-mhhhs&t=149s

Next steps:
- 
- optimize code
- sprite for resources
- health bar for player, defender, enemy
- make a home-tower sprite
- background sprite
- custom properties for different defenders e.g. speed, damage
- custom properties for different enemies e.g. speed, damage
- damage animations, slow down on enemy attack
- upgrade defenders
- do not end game on enemy ran to 0 x coord
